    Real-time DPS meter for Aion 2 using OCR-based combat log analysis

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

A real-time DPS (Damage Per Second) meter specifically designed for **Aion 2**. The application captures screenshots of the in-game combat log, uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text, and calculates damage metrics with live visualization.

### Key Features

* **Real-time DPS Visualization** - Live graphs showing moving average and overall average DPS
* **Multi-threaded Architecture** - Efficient screen capture and OCR processing using thread pools
* **Intelligent Log Parsing** - Detects damage events, skill names, targets, and critical hits
* **Optimized Screen Capture** - Only processes new combat log entries, ignoring duplicate frames
* **Configurable** - Easy setup through `config.ini` file
* **Debug Mode** - Optional OCR visualization and detailed logging

### How It Works

1. **Screen Capture** - Continuously captures a specified region of the screen where the combat log is displayed
2. **Image Preprocessing** - Extracts colored text (damage, skills, names) and upscales for better OCR accuracy
3. **OCR Processing** - Uses Tesseract to recognize text from processed images in parallel threads
4. **Log Parsing** - Detects new combat log entries and extracts damage information using regex patterns
5. **DPS Calculation** - Computes moving average (1-second window) and overall average damage
6. **Real-time Plotting** - Displays interactive graphs using matplotlib with live updates

<!-- REQUIREMENTS -->
## Requirements

* **Python 3.12** (tested and verified)
* **Tesseract OCR** (external dependency)
* **Windows OS** (for screen capture functionality)

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation

### 1. Install Tesseract OCR

Download and install Tesseract OCR from the official repository:

**Windows:**
- Download installer: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
- Run the installer and note the installation path (default: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe`)

**Note:** The path to Tesseract must be configured in `config.ini` after installation.

### 2. Clone the Repository


<!-- Configuration -->
## Configuration

Open config.ini and configurate region to capture for your monitor and aion 2 combat chat position.

App requires to open combat log as full height view. Chat bubble -> Combat.

App was tested with UI Proportion set to Larger.

<!-- Notes -->
## Notes

App was created for myself and cleaned up before release to github.

I tested it with 2 monitors with requirements mentioned upper. Feel free to fork or write issues. Code can have bugs or bad patterns.

Data gathered from combat log can be used in more detailed analysis(by skills/by multiplier types)

<!-- Screenshots -->
## Screenshots

This is how should the combat chat look like to capture:

I recommend to set region like this:

If ocr_view enabled u can debug it viewing next window. Keep in mind that it works ugly now and window will be movable only on incoming combat log updates.
